### How It Works:
1. Input the 12 most likely scorelines and their probabilities in the sidebar.
2. Click the 'Predict' button to calculate the final correct score based on the predefined rules.
3. The final correct score will be displayed below.

### Rules Applied:
- **Rule 1:** If the highest frequency of correct score probability â„… ranges from 6.8â„… to 6.02â„…, pick the corresponding scoreline.
- **Rule 2:** If the highest correct score probability â„… is 12.9â„…, select the 5.71â„… correct score as the final correct score.
- **Rule 3:** ...
